# A Serverless web scraper on AWS Lambda

For detailed information about this project, go to [Half-Stack Full](http://dev.shielasandoval.com/dataops/serverless-web-scraper-on-aws-lambda.html).

## Pre-requisites

1. Python 3.7 environment

    If you're a Mac user, you would already have a Python 3 interpreter by default (use `python3` command instead of `python`). If your Python version does not match the needed version for this project, you can switch Python versions using an environment manager like Pyenv (`brew install pyenv`) or Anaconda.

2. AWS account and AWS CLI setup
    - to create an AWS account, [refer to this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html).
    - to set up AWS CLI on your machine, [refer to this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)

3. Serverless

    The quickest way to install Serverless is through `npm`. [Installation steps here](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started)
